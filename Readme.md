# About Project
Predicting of Stock Market Prices using Deep Learning LSTM Model, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network which can retain important information over time using memory cells.

# Development Procedure

1. Create a Web App and install the basic requirements :heavy_check_mark:
2. Create a Stock Symbol and pass it to the program :heavy_check_mark:
3. Get Live Data from Nifty as per the dates :heavy_check_mark:
4. Plot the StockPrice Vs Date :heavy_check_mark:
5. Data Preprocessing :heavy_check_mark:
6. Preparing the Data for LSTM :heavy_check_mark:
